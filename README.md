## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment and install the necessary libraries.

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chengchencon/FNO-Simulation.git
    cd FNO-Simulation
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required libraries**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment and installing the necessary libraries, you can run the script to get the results.

1. **Run the model script**:
    ```bash
    python model_script.py
    ```

2. **Check the output**:
    The results will be saved in the `results` directory. You can modify the script or use different input data as needed.

7. ## References

In my work, I have referred to the following excellent projects and articles:

1. [Project Name]([https://link](https://github.com/neuraloperator/neuraloperator)) - The Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under fixed resolution.
2. [Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations]([https://link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895)) - Author: Zongyi Li, Nikola Kovachki, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Burigede Liu, Kaushik Bhattacharya, Andrew Stuart, Anima Anandkumar
